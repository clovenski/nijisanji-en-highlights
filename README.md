# Nijisanji EN Highlights

Website to view raw highlights of the recent streams of the Nijisanji EN livers.

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️

This website has been deprecated and shut down to save 💰.

## Usage

Daily highlights will be published onto this website automatically. Embedded on the page are the video segments of those highlights - just click play to watch them. If you are on mobile, click the thumbnail to watch the clip / stream on YouTube.

## ⚠️ Notice ⚠️

This application is more of a personal project for me, so don't expect frequent updates.

It's also not free to host and power this application so it can be torn down at any time.

## FAQ

Who are you?
> Just a fellow Nijisanji fan!

Is there more than 1 highlight for each stream?
> Yes. Currently it only shows the top highlight, but there is highlights data for the entire stream. The rest will be made available in the future.

Is there a way to see all the highlights of a specific stream?
> Currently no, but that's on the todo list and will be implemented in the future.

Can I filter for a specific streamer?
> Yes, there is a filter button at the top of the page. Click it, then select which streamer you'd like to filter for.

How far back in time do these highlights go?
> Up to 1 month ago. So the oldest stream shown can be up to 1 month old.

Why are there highlights that don't even make sense?
> The process to gather these highlights is automated, so it's not going to be perfect. Think of it like it's trying to guess the top moments of a stream and you're just here to see what it can come up with.

What does the score mean?
> It's a loose representation of how likely it's an actual highlight of the stream. The higher it is, the more likely. But again it's not perfect, so take it with a grain of salt.

Does this show membership videos?
> No.

Are the dates converted to my local timezone?
> Yes.

Will streams of new EN livers get added here?
> Yes, they will get added once their channel gets created.
